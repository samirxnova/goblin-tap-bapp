# 🎯 Goblin Tap - Citrea Blockchain Game


A fast-paced, skill-based game built on the Citrea blockchain where players bet cBTC on their ability to quickly tap goblins as they pop up from holes within a time limit. The more goblins you tap, the bigger the reward!

  

## 🎮 Game Overview

  

**Goblin Tap** is a hybrid blockchain game that combines:

-  **Off-chain gameplay**: Fast, responsive tapping mechanics with smooth animations

-  **On-chain betting**: Secure, transparent betting using cBTC on the Citrea network

-  **Skill-based rewards**: Player skill directly influences payout multipliers

  

### Game Mechanics

-  **Objective**: Tap goblins as they pop up from holes within 15 seconds

-  **Betting**: Place cBTC bets before each round

-  **Payouts**:

- Less than 5 Goblins: Loss of bet

- 5-7 Goblins: 1.2x payout

- 8-9 Goblins: 1.5x payout

- 10+ Goblins: 2.0x payout

  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

  

-  **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

-  **Game Engine**: React with custom interval management for smooth gameplay

-  **Authentication**: Privy for seamless Web3 onboarding

-  **Blockchain**: Citrea network (Bitcoin ZK-Rollup)

-  **Smart Contracts**: Solidity for betting and payout logic

-  **Blockchain Interaction**: Viem for Ethereum-compatible interactions

  

## 🚀 Quick Start

  

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+

- npm or yarn

- A Privy account (for authentication)

- Citrea testnet cBTC for testing

  

### Installation

  

1.  **Clone the repository**

```bash

git clone https://github.com/samirxnova/goblin-tap-bapp.git

cd goblin-tap-bapp-main

```

  

2.  **Install dependencies**

```bash

npm install

```

  

3.  **Environment Setup**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env

PRIVATE_KEY="your-wallet-private-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTING_POOL_ADDRESS="batting-pool-contract-address"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID="privy-app-id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOBLIN_TAP_ADDRESS="goblin-tap-contract-address"

```

  

4.  **Deploy Smart Contract**

```bash

# Deploy the GoblinTap.sol contract to Citrea testnet

# Update the contract address in .env.local

```

  

5.  **Run the development server**

```bash

npm run dev

```

  

6.  **Open your browser**

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

  

## 🔧 Configuration

  

### Privy Setup

1. Visit [Privy Console](https://console.privy.io/)

2. Create a new app

3. Copy your App ID to `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID`

  

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. Deploy `contracts/GoblinTap.sol` to Citrea testnet

2. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the deployed address

3. Fund the contract with cBTC for payouts

  

## 🎯 How to Play

  

1.  **Connect Wallet**: Click "Login to Play" and connect via Privy

2.  **Place Bet**: Enter your cBTC bet amount and confirm the transaction

3.  **Tap Goblins**: Quickly tap goblins as they pop up from holes

4.  **Beat the Clock**: You have 15 seconds to tap as many goblins as possible

5.  **Claim Winnings**: Automatically claim your rewards based on performance

## 🔒 Security Considerations

  

### Current Implementation (Prototype)

-  **Client-side verification**: Game results are reported by the client

-  **Trust model**: Players can potentially modify client to cheat

-  **Suitable for**: Testing and demonstration purposes

  

### Production Requirements

For a production deployment with real value, implement:

-  **ZK Proofs**: Cryptographic proof of correct game execution

-  **Oracles**: Secure off-chain computation via Chainlink Functions

-  **Multi-party verification**: Multiple validators for game results

  

## 🧪 Testing

  

### Smart Contract Testing

```bash

# Deploy to testnet and test betting flow

npm  run  test:contract

```

  

### Game Testing

```bash

# Run the development server

npm  run  dev

  

# Test the complete game flow:

# 1. Connect wallet

# 2. Place bet

# 3. Play game

# 4. Claim winnings

```

  

## 🚀 Deployment
